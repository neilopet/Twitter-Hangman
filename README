To play Twitter Hangman, tweet "play" sans quotes to @realhangman.

Once a game is started, realhangman will reply with a category and word length. 

Proceed by tweeting the characters you would like to guess to @realhangman.

Example:
@realhangman a
@realhangman e
@realhangman s

The bot will reply with the remaining attempts (starts at 6) and the status of the current word.

You can solve the game if you dare, by tweeting the full word to @realhangman.
Example:
@realhangman pennsylvania

The bot will reply stating whether or not your guess was valid.

Once a game has finished, you should remove your tweets to the bot so that you may tweet the same characters again if you choose to play another round.
